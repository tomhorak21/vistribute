| Changelog | `{"0.0.1":"Initial version.","0.0.2":"Enabled view board toggling via toolbar or shortcut (mod+o). Improved data handling.","0.0.3":"Added virtual device abstraction. Added functionality to move back views when vistribute overlay is closed.","0.0.4":"Renamed virtual devices to surfaces. Improved checks to avoid invalid states.","0.0.5":"Added basic constraint handling (e.g., to exclude views or deivces from distribution). Added first alpha version of a control panel. Some fixes.","0.0.6":"Updated retrieving/storing/handling of device data. Removed dependency to Device Manager.","0.0.7":"Improvment of control panel; still in alpha.","0.0.8":"Improved control panel: added surface and distribution preview; added action bar; added support to ignore/unignore selected views or surfaces.","0.0.9":"Extended retrieving of view properties. Standard comp properties plus hasSvg (= is visualization) and dataPoints.","0.0.10":"Added comparison of visual similartiy based on view properties; views get points for matching properties. Currently considering template (3p), props (2p), size (1p), and dataPoints (1p).","0.0.11":"Added initial view-surface-assignment algorithm based on view space requirement and available surface space. First matching groups (views with visual similarity &gt;= 5), then all other views.","0.0.12":"Added first local-layout-algortihm. Groups are put into columns and possibly sub-rows.","0.0.13":"Incorporated a constrained layout library (autolayout.js) to optimize the previous determined column layout.","0.1.0":"Many fixes and improvements to distribution and layout algortihms. First version with a working 'vistribution'.","0.1.1":"Applied improvement and fixes to distribution/local layouting. Discard usage of autolayout.js","0.1.2":"Introduced a minimap feature highlighting current distribution as well as changes.","0.1.3":"Improved functionality of control panel by supporting further constraint definitions.","0.1.4":"Added first version of data observer, analyzing the dataflow for connectivity and data similarity between views. An exclusive connectivity is considered in the distribution.","0.1.5":"New control panel.","0.1.6":"Improved layouting: better alignment of columns.","0.1.7":"Only consider view updates when view joins/leaves.","0.1.8":"Minor fixes and cleanup","0.1.9":"Fixed issues in device observer config"}` |
